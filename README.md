Project Title:
✋ Hand Gesture Recognition and Classification Using Machine Learning



Project Description:
This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition and classification model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. The system enables intuitive human–computer interaction by allowing gesture-based control without the need for physical input devices. The project involves data collection, image/video preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and real-time or offline gesture classification.
